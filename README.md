# DININGO

## Getting Started

These are the steps to get the project up and running locally

I only have Mac instructions for now. If you're on PC good luck.

### 1. Clone the repo

Then cd into the client directory

### 2. Install dependencies

```
npm run setup
```

### 3. Create .env file

Create a file called `.env` in the `client/` directory. Put in it:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```
obviously replacing the 'your_google_api_key' part with your own google api key

### 4. Run the app

```
npm run start
```
will run the development version of the application. It can be accessed at http://localhost:8080 by default
